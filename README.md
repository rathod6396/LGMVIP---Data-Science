**Data Science Internship (VIP)**

**Author: - Parth Kantilal Rathod**

**Batch: November 2021**

# *BEGINNER LEVEL TASK*


#  Task 1
**1) Iris Flowers Classification ML Project :**
The goal is to create a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of these irises whose species
are already known, so that we can predict the species for the new irise

Aim As a security/defense analyst, We have try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

STEPS
Step 1 - Import Libraries
Step 2 - Importing the data
Step 3 - Cleaning The Data
Step 4 - Number of terrorist activities over years**
Step 5 - Different attacking methods used by the terrorist
Step 6 - Terrorism across all regions
Step 7 - Top countries affected by terrorism
Step 8 - Terrorist Groups with Highest Terror Attacks  

  
# Task 2 
**2) Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm :**

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to  predict the right class accordingly.
